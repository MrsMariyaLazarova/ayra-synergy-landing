                        <span class="red-color bold"><a href="#">young and beautiful</a></span>, as I did 20 years ago. I thought about plastic-surgery, but because my doctor classified me to be part of the "risk patient group", I was unable to follow
                        through with this option. However, what I heard after that, in a talk show, changed my life.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="padding-mobile">When I was younger, my skin was taut and beautiful, and I never had <span class="bold"><a href="#" class="perple">problems with wrinkles</a></span>. I finished College, without even a wrinkle on my face. I started working in a locally
                        based company and developed some bad habits like e.g. not to use sunscreen every day, drink liqueur, and from time to time smoke a cigarette.</p>

                    <p class="padding-mobile">With each decade, my face looked more crumpled. The wrinkles where there. I <span class="red-color bold"><a href="#">felt bad and ashamed</a></span> ... When I went out, with my friends, I always felt insecure, left rapidly for the
                        bathroom, to refresh my make-up. I did not like what I was seeing in the mirror, actually I did avoid mirrors completely.</p>

                    <p class="p-mob padding-mobile">One day, I overheard my husband calling me an "old wrinkled prune". When I confronted him, he confessed "I CHEATED on you because you are <span class="red-color bold"><a href="#">too old!</a></span>" after that, he divorced me to live
                        with a woman who is much younger than me! That was <span class="bold">a painful, embarrassing shock</span>. Until this moment, I didn't know that he feels that way about my looks. I kind of thought he is my man and he will never
                        leave me, no matter how old and wrinkly I was getting year after year.</p>

I wanted to make him feel sorry for his words and actions. Today I am grateful for this comment because it <span class="bold"><a href="#" class="perple">motivated me</a></span>.
                            I knew that I had to make my face and my skin look
                            <span class="bold"><a href="#" class="perple">healthier</a></span> , for me, and for me alone. If I had not changed my lifestyle, I would really look like an old dried out prune. I stared for quite a while into a mirror, looked
                            at myself, it was painful, and I knew that I had to do something quickly!</p>

                            <span class="red-color bold"><a href="#">plastic surgery</a></span> , but hesitated to deliver myself to the scalpel. It looked quite gloomy. When I watched this tv talk show a couple of weeks ago, I heard how Catherine Zeta-Jones
                            revealed Dr. Osborne's <span class="italic bold"><a href="#" class="perple">skincare-secret</a></span>.

                    When I heard about it, I was surprised how <span class="italic bold"><a href="#" class="perple dark">easy, inexpensive and effective</a></span> this technique is, which made me try it out immediately.

                <p class="padding-mobile">
                    So, I <span class="bold">ordered Synergy</span> because I was so frustrated that all other products did not show any desired results. I received it in a couple of days and I thought - <span class="italic">This anti-wrinkle cream was my last hope!</span>
                </p>

                <p class="padding-mobile">
                    From the first application, I was shocked, how <span class="bold"><a href="#" class="perple dark">extreme</a></span> the results were.
                </p>

                <p class="padding-mobile">
                    Wrinkles, fine lines and dark spots were already considerably and <span class="bold"><a href="#" class="perple dark">visibly reduced</a></span>. Right in front of my eyes! I was amazed about the results and <span class="bold"><a href="#" class="perple dark">felt 5 years younger</a></span>.
                    It felt like I was able to see how my crinkles and wrinkles went away!

                    I don't know how I should describe it! I felt <span class="italic bold"><a href="#" class="perple dark">a warm prickling</a></span> on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked into my mirror, and my face appeared to
                    be a bit rosy. The result of the revitalized blood, which shot on the hull of my skin, to revive my face, after the cream was absorbed, by my skin, let my face look taut, and I had a beautiful glow in my face.

                    The crinkles on my forehead, the loose, dropping skin, on my neck, crows-feet, even my liver spots, in my face disappeared COMPLETELY. I never felt or saw anything, which gave my skin so much strength, never mind how expensive the product was!

                <p class="padding-mobile"> <span class="bold"><a href="#" class="perple dark">After 2 weeks</a></span> passed, my skin did not just stay like this, it was better than it was 20 years ago. At this point my friends and family were shocked. They could not believe the
                    difference, and were persuaded that I must have had a Botox-Treatment.

                                Yeah! This stuff is awesome! My best friend Gina is using it, while I am trying for years, to <span class="bold"><a href="#">get rid of my wrinkles</a></span>, but nothing ever worked. Patty showed me that it is possible,
                                to reach ones goals… To look good again after my own divorce. It's not easy... but this story inspired me! I just ordered the Synergy beauty creams...and I have a really good feeling about it!

                                I've tried out so many products and nothing ever works as promised. I would like to try it out, but honestly, I cannot really believe in it! Can anybody tell me, if it really works?
